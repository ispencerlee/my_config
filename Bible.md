## The beginning 

1. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
2. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spril of God was hovering over the waters.  
3. And God said, "Let there be light", and there was light. 
4. God saw that light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
5. God called the light "day", and the darkness he called "night". And there was evening, and there was morning--the first day. 
6. And God said, "Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water."
7. So God made the vault "sky". And there was evening, and there was morning--the second day.
8. And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear". And it was so.
10. Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds." And it was so.
